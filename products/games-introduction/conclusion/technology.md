MetaReverse is an NFT-based game that is part of the 'play-to-earn' metaverse, built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain. The main function is performed by BEP-1155 smart contracts - this standard allows the BEP-20 and BEP-721 standards to be combined on one blockchain, thus combining in-game fungible and non-fungible tokens. One of the game's key technologies is NFT (non-fungible token). MetaReverse allows to use them to purchase special character powers and further use them in the game. NFTs are gaming items with a real value. Their value increases over time, and the player can easily buy/sell them or use them in the game for their intended purpose. In order to implement game mechanics that combine DeFi and NFT technologies, an internal utility game token $Vintk will be released. The token plays a major role in the game and is intended to be used as in-game currency. The token is used to pay out accrued rewards, to purchase and monetise NFT characters
