# Launchpad

## Launch

Our platforms for launching tokens, pools and NFTs will be controlled, only projects with KYC will be able to participate, although we always recommend that you do your own research.

## _**MetaReverse Launchpad**_

MetaReverse will have their own launchpad where projects can create their own token. Launch on our platform. This can be a fairlaunch, private sale, whitelisted or public presale. Projects will be able to KYC, have audits available, and our 'MTR Launchpad NFT Badge' (will be explained in the next topic) also we will have tools available to help you so you can use them with your own research! we will have this because we care about our community and safety is our number 1 priority!

Always Do Your Own Research.

## _**MetaReverse Launchpad NFT Badge**_

Our nft badges will have different kind of tiers.&#x20;

How higher the tier how more effort/money the project did spend and can be 'trusted more'

Tier 1 will simply cost 1BNB

Tier 2 Will cost 2 BNB And Requires KYC&#x20;

Tier 3 Will Cost 3BNB And Requires KYC, Team Tokens locked for atleast 3months with a vesting period.

Tier 4 Will Cost 4BNB And Requires KYC,Team Tokens locked for atleast 4months with a vesting period.

Tier 5 Will Cost 5BNB And Requires KYC Team Tokens locked for atleast 6 months with a vesting period. And Audit is required.

The NFT Badge based on your tier will be sent to the token, can only be used once and will be shown at your MetaReverse launchpad profile(where the presale is being held)
