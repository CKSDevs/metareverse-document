# Earn with your NFTS

### Earn With NFTS

Our NFTs have a real utility, if you are owner of the NFT you can stake it and earn  $MTR. The  amount of your reward is based on your NFT Ranking score/share%  and the amount of MetaReverse NFT Boosters that are being opened. Rewards for the NFTs comes from transaction tax & the amount of MetaReverse Boosters being opened.

## üí∞ NFT staking and $Vintk earn

Our NFTs have one great and cool difference unlike all other NFTs ‚Äî they have real usage. That means, you can not only collect our cool MetaReverse Species, but also use them for real purpose.&#x20;

**The main purpose is a staking/$MTR earning.**

**Main formula of the project:** **High booster opening volume = High price of $MTR = high rewards for the NFTs**

**Main formula of NFT staking:** **The higher the rarity of the NFT = Higher $MTR-$Ventk LP rewards**

So, when you get your NFT, you **can stake it and earn $MTR-Ventk **<mark style="color:purple;">**LP**</mark>**.** You **can stake any amount**, no limits on that. When you stake your NTFs you start getting rewards in USDT, which you need to harvest, same like in farms. You can stake your NFTs <mark style="color:green;">only in the corresponding season.</mark> After season ends ‚Äî you will need to <mark style="color:green;">get NFTs of new season,</mark> to continue getting rewards.



‚ùì **Where rewards come from** ‚ùì

6<mark style="color:purple;">**%**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">from</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">**each transaction**</mark> of our token. But our system, is not that simple. Price of eggs and rewards are changing in case of volume. That means, the more activity in the project from the people, will bring bigger rewards.



<mark style="color:green;">**Note**</mark> ‚Äî We can't show APY or APR because this **is not a farm**, but we are showing **approximate rewards rate.** Make sure, that **rewards are changed daily.** That depends on the amount of staked NFTs and amount of funds which came from volume. <mark style="color:green;">More people = fewer rewards, but more volume = more rewards.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">**Important**</mark> ‚Äî you will **NOT get** any rewards, if you just have NFTs in your wallet, **stake them to start earning BPM-USDT LP.** You will NOT get BPM-USDT LP in your wallet automatically, you **need to harvest** it on our website.
