# Still Stuck with Questions?

## _**What to do with these NFTs?**_

_**These are NFTs**_ which you can collect. There are different kind of rarities, factions and the points you get for every NFT are based on the rarity + faction(Species, Lizarun,Sonamuh,Pingreks and Hippotamix) . You can stake your NFTs and get $MTR as a reward.

## How can I get more $MTR-$Vintk LP tokens?

There are 4 ways of getting more LP tokens:

* 1\) Use our special Liquidity contract and simply buy $MTR-$Vintk tokens.
* 2\) Stake NFTs in the pools and get $MTR-$Vintk as a reward.
* 3\) Stake already existing $MTR-BNB LP tokens in auto-compound pool.
* 4\) Sell us your NFTs through buyback contract.

## You see and hear it all the time P2E games, What can you expect?

First of all, through the time we will create some simple p2e games, where you could earn $Vintk tokens or NFTs. But for sure, you will need to take risks, you can both earn a lot and lose a lot. Our main goal is to develop a Metaverse and a fighting P2E game about our 4 species within the MetaReverse.

## Can I earn $VINTK tokens?

Yes, you can! Simply go to the [staking page](https://www.farms.metareverse.finance) in our menu, where you can stake your $MTR tokens and farm more of them (amount based on the volume of $MTR).
