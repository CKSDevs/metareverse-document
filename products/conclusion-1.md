# Conclusion

Increasingly, many blockchain-based gaming projects turn out to be fraudulent. Most of the revenues from such games go into the developers' pockets, and the players who have invested their money in them get nothing in return. The goal of ArenaVerse is to create a high-quality product and build a fair ecosystem for project participants. The players should own their assets and have the full right to dispose of them. Any value contributed to the project will be rewarded.
