### CHALLENGE STATEMENT <a href="#challenge" id="challenge"></a>

MetaReverse is on a mission to create a strong community of NFT enthusiasts (content creators, traders, collectors, etc.) wanting to buy, sell or trade NFTs, in a hassle free environment.

Here's the challenge...

There are already several NFT marketplaces, most of which need programming expertise to make successful use of them, which introduces more difficulty and the lack of accessibility. They are typically complex to use and difﬁcult to understand and require in-depth trading knowledge and programming skills, which alienates new customers and proves to be time-consuming for the more experienced traders.

Users can only buy Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with cryptocurrencies. While on a worldwide scale high percentage of users do not have access to cryptocurrencies or simply do not want to use them, not to talk of using to purchase a simple NFT.

Another issue NFTs are facing is the fact that only traditional media types such as art, music, videos as well as gaming assets are on the market.

## VISION <a href="#vision" id="vision"></a>

NFTs are the future of collectibles; however, that can be the case for things and physical objects we use daily. These digital assets are tradable and provable representations of their underlying media, whatever it may be.

is taking NFTs out of their infancy and bringing them to the real world by unlocking their true potential in a world where everything digital or physical is bought, sold, or traded as an NFT. MetaReverse is going to be a user friendly NFT launchpad, marketplace and exchange aiming to help users to automate digital to physical redemptions.

NFTs on Niftify are going to be used as proof of ownership and history tracking for even physical items, as well as proof of authenticity for valuable digital as well as physical assets.



### SOLUTION <a href="#solution" id="solution"></a>

Some platforms have implemented a simple type of NFT marketplaces. Still, neither of them is able to solve all of the problems previously mentioned.

MetaReverse confidently faces the challenges of exponential growth with the NFT marketplace and delivers unique solutions:

MetaReverse features an all-inclusive platform, available to carry out almost everything related to NFTs. In other words, it is taking an active step in the evolution of NFTs, bringing them from the dark, and introducing them into real-life utility and a world where anyone anywhere could sell, buy and even trade both physical and digital assets as NFT. It doubles as an ecosystem that pays utmost attention to authenticity with relevant frameworks for proof of ownership and smart tracking.



#### NFT Swap <a href="#nftswap" id="nftswap"></a>

Using MetaReverse, collectors are allowed to exchange one NFT for another i.e. swap NFTs. For instance, as a user, let’s assume that you want to exchange an NFT with a lesser value than another NFT you'd love to have. In this case, all you need to do is back your current NFT with added value, which could be in the form of a token. Essentially, this works just like Apple's and other Phone trade-in programs, where you can swap an older version for a newer one by adding some cash. However, in this case, the added cash is in the form of a token.\
\
As a user, you can always propose NFT swaps with another user, and when you first initiate this proposal for a certain collection, you need to allow MetaReverse Marketplace to access your NFT, so when the user accepts the swap it gets processed automatically. Niftify saves this request into its database and tells the other user that there is a pending swap proposal. The other user may decide to either reject or accept the swap. And once rejected, the platform cancels the swap, which becomes invisible and inaccessible to either of the users, if there are no other matching NFTs that you want. Conversely, suppose the other user accepts the swap, you or the other user can then initiate the swap process through the smart contract. It is pretty straightforward and somewhat fun.

#### NFT Launchpad <a href="#nftlaunchpad" id="nftlaunchpad"></a>

With MetaReverse, artists, startups, as well as companies, can access all they need to offer collections using a specialized and customized sub-web page specifically dedicated to their project. This predominantly considers the specific amount of NFTs with varying rarity levels in the order of their increasing value.\
\
Part of MetaReverse mission to support artists is connecting them with collectors. MetaReverse is working to bring the magic of the artistic community online with opportunities to engage with fans and collectors. At NFT Launchpad, users will be able to support the creative endeavors of various artists.

#### Commission <a href="#commission" id="commission"></a>

For every NFT sold, MetaReverse takes a specific percentage of commission – when sold in other cryptocurrencies or fiat, it takes a meager 5%, and when sold using the platform's native utility token, $MTR, it takes an even lesser 2.5%).
