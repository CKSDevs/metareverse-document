### CHALLENGE STATEMENT <a href="#challenge" id="challenge"></a>

MetaReverse is on a mission to create a strong community of NFT enthusiasts (content creators, traders, collectors, etc.) wanting to buy, sell or trade NFTs, in a hassle free environment.

Here's the challenge...

There are already several NFT marketplaces, most of which need programming expertise to make successful use of them, which introduces more difficulty and the lack of accessibility. They are typically complex to use and difﬁcult to understand and require in-depth trading knowledge and programming skills, which alienates new customers and proves to be time-consuming for the more experienced traders.

Users can only buy Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with cryptocurrencies. While on a worldwide scale high percentage of users do not have access to cryptocurrencies or simply do not want to use them, not to talk of using to purchase a simple NFT.

Another issue NFTs are facing is the fact that only traditional media types such as art, music, videos as well as gaming assets are on the market.

## VISION <a href="#vision" id="vision"></a>

NFTs are the future of collectibles; however, that can be the case for things and physical objects we use daily. These digital assets are tradable and provable representations of their underlying media, whatever it may be.

Niftify is taking NFTs out of their infancy and bringing them to the real world by unlocking their true potential in a world where everything digital or physical is bought, sold, or traded as an NFT. Niftify is going to be a user friendly NFT launchpad, marketplace and exchange aiming to help users to automate digital to physical redemptions.

NFTs on Niftify are going to be used as proof of ownership and history tracking for even physical items, as well as proof of authenticity for valuable digital as well as physical assets.

### SOLUTION <a href="#solution" id="solution"></a>

Some platforms have implemented a simple type of NFT marketplaces. Still, neither of them is able to solve all of the problems previously mentioned.

\
\


Niftify confidently faces the challenges of exponential growth with the NFT marketplace and delivers unique solutions:

\
\


Niftify features an all-inclusive platform, available to carry out almost everything related to NFTs. In other words, it is taking an active step in the evolution of NFTs, bringing them from the dark, and introducing them into real-life utility and a world where anyone anywhere could sell, buy and even trade both physical and digital assets as NFT. It doubles as an ecosystem that pays utmost attention to authenticity with relevant frameworks for proof of ownership and smart tracking.

#### Creators Ethos <a href="#creator" id="creator"></a>

Niftify is one of the reliable projects exploring the concept of lazy minting. With its lazy minting framework and Layer 2 (Polygon), Niftify seeks to offer a feasible solution to the raging concern governing Ethereum with cold heart sympathy: Insanely exorbitant gas fees. Of course, when gas fees are unreasonably excessive, mining NFTs can be pretty expensive, which ultimately results in creators tending to spend more and more cash to launch their NFTs. There are even situations when an item is sold, but the creator still suffers a loss resulting from the high gas fee required to mint the NFT. However, fortunately, Niftify is offering every creator a hand into an ecosystem that caters to their needs and arms them with all that is required for success in their efforts. Thus, even during a period of high gas fees, creators can always rest assured that they have a way out.\
\
All in all, Niftify, aiming to be a fully licensed marketplace, gives a viable alternative to help you propel your talent and maximize your income with several attractive features. Another of such the premium accounts, where you can access flexible profile customization to help you put your brand out there, on the mainstream. Profiles are tailored to the creator’s pursuit. Even with no technical prowess, creators can always navigate their premium and fully customized account.

#### EIP-2981: NFT Royalty Standard <a href="#eip" id="eip"></a>

In a most basic term, this standard is what allows contracts supporting select ERC interfaces, to signal that a specific royalty amount that a creator or any right holder should receive anytime anyone sells or re-sells their creations. This is the best standard out there for any NFT marketplace looking to offer support to evolving NFT creators, and evidently, Niftify is one of such. Adopting this standard, Niftify allows creators to hold their ownership right of their artworks and creations, and access a resale royalty that may range up to 25%. Undoubtedly, EIP-2981 has grown to be the industry standard, facilitating the seamless transfer of royalties between marketplaces. As such, leveraging this is definitely a plus for the project. Creators also have the ability to transfer the royalties to the first buyer and thus potentially increase the value of NFT.

#### NFT Swap <a href="#nftswap" id="nftswap"></a>

Using Niftify, collectors are allowed to exchange one NFT for another i.e. swap NFTs. For instance, as a user, let’s assume that you want to exchange an NFT with a lesser value than another NFT you'd love to have. In this case, all you need to do is back your current NFT with added value, which could be in the form of a token. Essentially, this works just like Apple's and other Phone trade-in programs, where you can swap an older version for a newer one by adding some cash. However, in this case, the added cash is in the form of a token.\
\
As a user, you can always propose NFT swaps with another user, and when you first initiate this proposal for a certain collection, you need to allow Niftify Marketplace to access your NFT, so when the user accepts the swap it gets processed automatically. Niftify saves this request into its database and tells the other user that there is a pending swap proposal. The other user may decide to either reject or accept the swap. And once rejected, the platform cancels the swap, which becomes invisible and inaccessible to either of the users, if there are no other matching NFTs that you want. Conversely, suppose the other user accepts the swap, you or the other user can then initiate the swap process through the smart contract. It is pretty straightforward and somewhat fun.

#### NFT Launchpad <a href="#nftlaunchpad" id="nftlaunchpad"></a>

With Niftify, artists, startups, as well as companies, can access all they need to offer collections using a specialized and customized sub-web page specifically dedicated to their project. This predominantly considers the specific amount of NFTs with varying rarity levels in the order of their increasing value.\
\
Part of Niftify's mission to support artists is connecting them with collectors. Niftify is working to bring the magic of the artistic community online with opportunities to engage with fans and collectors. At NFT Launchpad, users will be able to support the creative endeavors of various artists.

#### Commission <a href="#commission" id="commission"></a>

For every NFT sold, Niftify takes a specific percentage of commission – when sold in other cryptocurrencies or fiat, it takes a meager 5%, and when sold using the platform's native utility token, NIFT, it takes an even lesser 2.5%).

#### Approach to Buyer's Security <a href="#approach" id="approach"></a>

Niftify has several frameworks to ensure transparency in its functionalities. With multiple [NFT licenses](https://www.niftify.io/licences) available on the all-inclusive platform, buyers can be sure of what they are purchasing before the transaction or what they might have bought following the transaction. There are NFT license types 1-6, each embodying various features tailored to protect the rights and security of any buyer and giving them a clear overview of whatever asset they are purchasing.\
\
Besides NFT licenses, Niftify also uses an escrow system to facilitate the sales and purchase of real-life items. It serves as an independent digital intermediary to guarantee that every buyer gets their pNFT delivered to them. As seen in almost every eCommerce and finance-related project, escrow services are now becoming an active part of the blockchain, representing the concerned accounts. Its primary duty is fund disbursement when a specific set of instructions are met accordingly.

#### Ecosystem Powered by Niftify (B2B) <a href="#ecosystem" id="ecosystem"></a>

With the B2B framework coupled with white label sales strategy, Niftify offers a time and effort-saving alternative to marketing your creations. Clients get to work together with a team of experts while accessing every advantageous feature to increase their offerings. With this, the resources clients get to direct your marketing efforts also tend to be minimized considerably.\
\
As a project built on a PasS notion with a reasonable subscription model, Niftify delivers an integrated solution and a full stack of services to everyone looking to access them. It allows anyone to customize their own marketplace with full support, access to technology, licenses, and users.

#### Data Harvesting <a href="#data" id="data"></a>

Niftify also has functional and active systems that oversee the automated collection of users' data, thus allowing every user, particularly businesses established on the platform, to get ready and anticipate the potential market trends. In addition, the entire process is automated, including the discovery of sensitive data.\
\
One of the concerns in NFTs today is the issue of overpriced or, generally, unfair pricing of assets. Niftify helps determine a fair price for specific NFTs by considering their market demand within a particular period to curb this concern. Niftify aims to become the go-to provider of the actual current NFT value estimation in different cycles of the NFT’s existence, from the early low demand cycle to its popularity. This data may be used in numerous applications, for example, escrow, insurance, collateralization as an NFT asset, and similar.

### MARKETING AND TARGET AUDIENCE <a href="#marketing-and-target-audience" id="marketing-and-target-audience"></a>

When we analyze the market capitalization of NFTs, the industry grew 17% in 2019 and was forecasted to grow up to 50% more by the time 2020 ended. NFT market capitalization has managed to exceed its 2020 forecast and according to the NFT Report 2020, published by L'Atelier BNP Paribas and Nonfungible.com, grew by 299 percent in 2020, when it was valued at over $250 million.

More than $2 billion was spent on NFTs, during the first quarter of 2021 — representing an increase of about 2,100% from Q4 2020 — according to a report from [NonFungible.com](https://nonfungible.com).

![](https://www.niftify.io/assets/img/lightpaper/NFT-lp-graphs.png)

Google search trends showed that NFTs surpass ICOs in 2017, and major companies and big brands have already taken an interest and have gotten involved in the industry.

Demand for NFTs has also doubled first quarter of 2021, with 73 thousand buyers and 33 thousand sellers. The future is in cryptocurrencies; that's why Niftify is has created a seamless and easily accessible NFT platform for everyone.

The target audience for Niftify includes anyone - B2C or B2B - interested in creating NFTs of any kind, as well as people who are just interested in buying, selling, trading, or fundraising via NFTs. The interesting part about all of this is the fact that the platform is fully focused on simplistically delivering this experience so that no matter the level of experience and knowledge, the end-user has the ability to get into the app and do anything they set their mind to.

### TOKEN & TOKENOMICS <a href="#token-and-tokenomics" id="token-and-tokenomics"></a>

Niftify is a creators-first ethos and platform on a mission. We seek to inspire hundreds of millions of non-crypto newbies via blockchain to buy, sell, exchange, or cash out NFTs.

Name of the token: NIFTIFY

Ticker name: NIFT

NIFT tokens are native utility tokens for the protocol and are used to incentivize actions across the system. A token allocation is reserved to enable the system to incentivize early adopters and contributors. This allows the system to overcome the bootstrapping challenge and also funds development.

* Total token supply: 200.000.000

#### USE CASES <a href="#use-cases" id="use-cases"></a>

Within the Niftify ecosystem, NIFT is used as a utility token that allows users to receive discounts when paying for the fees (2.5% instead of 5% when paying with other cryptocurrencies or fiat). A user’s NIFT token balance is also used to determine the level of access certain features, such as early access to new exclusive/special drops, premium custom profiles, and access to “members-only” areas, such as the upcoming NFT Launchpad (which will be a new way for artists to sell and users to bid on batches of NFTs rather than individual NFTs), celebrity/artist streams, games, and more over time.

### TECHNOLOGY <a href="#technology" id="technology"></a>

The platform includes backend and frontend functionalities. Main technologies used are: AWS architecture (EC2, Lambdas, Aurora, Cognito, Amplify, S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, IAM, RDS, CloudWatch ...), Sumsub, Zendesk, Figma, Alchemy, Algolia, Trustology, Google Analytics, Hotjar, Braintree. On the blockchain part, Niftify includes a collection of EVM-compatible Smart Contracts:

* ERC721 & ERC1155
  * Royalties support, EIP-2981
  * Lazy minting support
  * Metadata hashing - we store on-chain metadata hash to preserve integrity
* Marketplace
  * Royalties support, EIP-2981
  * Vault integration for custodial users
  * Dynamic fees
* Auction
  * Assets need to be transferred at auction start or bidding action to guarantee auction finish
* Vault
  * Storing assets (ERC20 & ERC721 & ERC1155) for custodial users and integration with other Smart Contracts
* NFT drops
  * Merkle Root Tree implementation for NFT drops, so creator can authorize complete NFT drop with one signature

#### FRONT-END <a href="#front-end" id="front-end"></a>

Client-side application will be built with Angular technology as a Single page application. This will make the user experience very smooth since the entirety of static data will be downloaded to client only once, any additional communication between client-side and back-end will only include the transfer of data. This is in opposition to traditional websites, which feel slow when switching pages, because the entirety of the website is first rendered on the server and sent to the client. To optimize the website further, we will also include Service Workers. Website will be developed with localization support for different languages but for MVP we will develop the website in English.

#### BACK-END <a href="#back-end" id="back-end"></a>

Back-end architecture is designed with horizontal scalability in mind. We will make heavy use of lightweight microservices, which can be scaled up on the fly during times of heavy traffic. To provide a singular API calling endpoint, we will be using an Application load balancer, which will also be responsible for delegation of network requests across microservices. We will regulate the workload of microservices with the help of Amazon’s Auto scaling groups, which will be hosted in more than one geographical location to prevent system downtime. For database solution we will be using Amazon Aurora, which provides the fastest transfer speeds possible for cloud solutions. Using Amazon Aurora also ensures 24/7 availability because there is no single point of failure. Database will be hosted in more than one of Amazon’s availability zones, which ensures the availability of the service in the event of natural disasters or similar events. Amazon Aurora is also horizontally scalable by default.
