## Stake $MTR, earn $MTR!

You've now got two delicious flavors of $MTR-$MTR Vintk Pool to choose from: Auto-compounding, and Manual. Read on to learn more!

### What’s the difference between the “Auto $MTR Pool” and the “Manual $MTR Pool”? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86" id="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86"></a>

**With both pools, you can simply stake your $MTR tokens to earn more $MTR** **tokens.**

But there are some differences:

**Manual $MTR**

* You need to harvest or compound (reinvest) your **$MTR** by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of BNB for transaction fees.
* Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn’t include compounding.
* Deposits [SYRUP Token](syrup-pool-faq.md#whats-syrup-token) to your wallet upon staking

**Auto CAKE**

* Stake your $MTR and forget about it! The $MTR you stake in this Vintk Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee.
* The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking. See below.
* Does not deposit Vintk to your wallet upon staking

### What are the fees for the Auto $MTR Vintk Pool?

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

\*\*Unstaking fee \*\*

* **0.1%  if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more $MTR in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 $MTR, then 0.02 $MTR would be subtracted as the performance fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
The $MTR collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular $MTR token burns.

This is a good thing for $MTR holders because it reduces the overall amount of $MTR tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### What's the best way to use the Auto $MTR Syrup Pool? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520" id="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520"></a>

Simple: stake your $MTR, but only withdraw after 72 hours (if you need to). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

### What’s the Auto $MTR bounty?

**Auto $MTR Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto $MTR pool users’ pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto $MTR Pool’s compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of $MTR you receive will be greater than the BNB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!
