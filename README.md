# MetaReverse Intro

![](<.gitbook/assets/masthead-twitter-3- (1) (1).png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
#### In the Reverse of the Meta world, you save planets, play, win, bet and follow art and the best projects in one place.
{% endhint %}

## ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### Innovation

MetaReverse wants to position itself as one of the cheapest exchanges to trade tokens.

### Low fees

Why pay more? MetaReverse runs on Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin.\
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.\
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, PancakeSwap doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## 💸 Earn

> Earn MTR and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.

### Earn tokens with Vintk Pools&#x20;

Stake $MTR, earn free tokens. It’s really that easy.\
$MTR will be earning tens of millions of USD worth of free tokens each week from major projects. New projects join the party every day, so you can earn more, for even longer.

### Earn MTR with Trenk Yield Farms

Stake LP tokens, earn MTR. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the Vintk Pools, but can earn higher APR to offset the risk.

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn’t supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).

> MetaReverse makes making money fun.
